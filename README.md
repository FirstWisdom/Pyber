Three trends observed based on the data:
  1) The higher the average fare was the lower number of rides were taken. This is natural because people typically try to avoid spending excessive amounts of money.
  2) The areas with higher population densities had more rides taken than areas with lower populations. This may be a result of the desire to avoid the stress caused by "road rage" by having someone else drive them to their destination.
  3) The areas with more rides also had more drivers. This is also natural since more business means a higher pay.
